1.It has a well-developed all terrain drive system 
2. Works on dc motors and is found to be light in weight
3. found to run on all types of terrain
Backdrops:
1. Can only shoot or launch one particular missile at at time
2. as per the need statement it  cannot shoot in a 360 degree angle unless the tank itself is moved about

1.	Runs on all type of terrains
2.	Shoots a missile for a range of 4ft
3.	Missile are pushed forth through combustion of match wax flames
4.	Is found to be attack resistance

Backdrops:
1.	Is very heavy in weight
2.	Is not completely automated
3.	Is not wireless as the aurdino does seem to be used
4.	Can only shoot one missile at a time unless refilled to shoot again


Automatic Missile Launcher with UDM RADAR

As the name suggests, this is a demonstration of one military application in which the system automatically launches a missile when any object is detected and it comes within the range. In the actual system, there is microwave RADAR that detects any object and immediately fires the missile to shoot the target.
 
 
Here in given system, it uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect any object. The sensor scans complete 360o circle by rotating continuously and when it detects any object that is within 2 feet (60 cm) range, it launches the missile. It is built using an AT89C51 microcontroller. It also uses LCD to display a different message as well as the distance of an object. 
 




MISSILE LAUNCHER ATTACHED TO A CAR

This type of a missile launcher is attached to an army car by mounting it on the rear end. This type of a missile launcher is capable of moving faster than the normal ones. These type of missile launchers can be self-propelled or manually operated. 
             The drawback of such a missile launcher is that it cannot move in all the terrains. The defense system of such a tank can sometimes be very weak.

The scale is approximatively the same than my other tanks (~1:18). The model is about 36cm long, 15cm wide, and 16cm tall. It requires 3mm material.
The tracks system is different from my other tanks, it will be much longer to make them. Be patient when you will make this tank.
There are many wheels, so be patient. Stack all the 9 layers (You can recognize them with the number of dots to know the order) around a toothpick, and be sure that it pokes out from the two sides. You can use the hollow rectangles to make sure all the layers are perpendicular to the toothpick.  Trap the 20mm screw inside it before hiding the head. It will be easier to fix the wheel on its support now rather than later.
Do not mistake the parts that are identical with the front wheel (the hole is 2mm for the front wheel and 3mm for the drive wheel).

Most of you might have got the idea from the project title itself that what kind of project it may be. The project is the demonstration of automatic missile launcher that sets missile to correct launching angle before itâ€™s actually launched (fired).
In actual automatic missile launcher system, the position of missile (means launching angle) is first set and then missile is fired so as it will hit the target. The missile angle is set in horizontal plane (azimuth angle) and vertical plane (elevation angle)
In the given demonstration model the missile angle is set for horizontal plane (azimuth angle) only. The angle can be set from 0o to 350o in step of 10o. A micro stepping stepper motor is used to set missile angle. The stepper motor rotates missile to set angle (azimuth). The project is build using AT89C52 micro controller and it uses push buttons to take user input to set angle and LCD to display missile angle.

1.	Launches 4 missiles one after the other
2.	Has a high range of flight length
3.	Is capable of shooting at the angle of all 360 degrees
4.	Is completely made of easily accessed items
5.	Is less cost efficient

Backdrops:
1.	Is not portable
2.	Cannot move from one place to another by its own
3.	Is not able to run on any type of terrains
4.	Is not automated 

Problem Definition 
The tank is expected to launch 4 missiles simultaneously as it has to be a semi automated system. The tank is also expected to be attack resistance and must be able to run on all types of terrains. Most of all the tank must be user friendly and should be quick enough in both launching missile as well as working on all types of terrains. The tank is expected to be handy to use and less in height and weight for best performance.
